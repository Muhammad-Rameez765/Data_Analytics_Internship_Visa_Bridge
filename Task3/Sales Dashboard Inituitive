Project: Sales Dashboard for a SaaS Company

 Objective:
To build an interactive sales dashboard that enables leadership to track revenue trends, identify underperforming segments, and support strategic decisions across regions and product tiers.

 Tools & Techniques Used:
Power BI for dashboard creation and interactivity

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, KMeans) for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and customer segmentation

SQL & Excel for joins, aggregation, and handling missing values

K-Means Clustering to group customers based on revenue behavior and contract patterns

 Key Dashboard Features:
Sales by Region & Product Tier with dynamic filters

Customer Segmentation visualized via clustering

Revenue and Churn Insights to highlight areas of improvement

KPIs like Average Revenue per Customer, Churn Rate, and Growth Opportunities

 Key Findings:
Two regions had low revenue despite large market sizes → Suggested increasing sales team presence.

The Basic tier had the highest churn → Recommended product experience improvement or bundling with support.

High contract length didn’t always correlate with revenue → Opportunity to optimize pricing for long-term plans.

 Outcome:
Delivered a user-friendly, fast-loading dashboard with actionable insights and business recommendations. Helped stakeholders identify key growth levers in the SaaS business model.
